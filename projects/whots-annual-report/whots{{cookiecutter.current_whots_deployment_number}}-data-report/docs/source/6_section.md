# Results

During the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} cruise (WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} mooring deployment, {{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_date}}), a
weakening front north of the Hawaiian Islands acted to weaken trades across the
region. This ridge to the north was eroding due to a weakening cold front north
of the ridge, which led to a downward trend in winds. The front continued to
weaken and sink southward through the weekend, keeping the winds light and
variable. Regular trades returned by mid-week. On October 10, winds
in the morning increased to 25 kt gusting to 35 kt, and there was a brief rain
event in the morning. Waves during the week were also low, with a small swell
from the north arriving mid-week.

Near-surface currents were almost 1 kt northward during transit to Station
ALOHA, turning southward upon arrival to Station ALOHA. Eventually, the current
shifted due north again, became somewhat weaker (about 0.5 kt), and remained
for approximately five days. There was a nearly low sea level just to the east
of Station ALOHA, not quite a fully formed eddy; it was reflected by northward
flow to the east and southward flow to the west. A combination of internal
semi-diurnal and diurnal tides and near-inertial oscillations was noticeable,
especially in vertical shear.

Conditions during the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} deployment on October 5 were favorable, with
light NNE winds of ~ 5 kt increasing to up to 10 kt by the end of the
deployment. There were clear skies and no precipitation in the region, and 1.0
to 1.5 m waves from the east, with a strong surface current towards ENE.

CTD casts conducted near the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} buoy (Station 52) after deployment
({numref}`figure6.4` and {numref}`figure6.5`) displayed a subsurface
salinity maximum between 70 and 80 dbar and a mixed layer 40 to 60 dbar deep.

During the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.next_whots_deployment}} cruise (WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} mooring recovery, {{cookiecutter.next_whots_deployment_date}}), a high-pressure ridge far north of the Hawaiian Islands maintained a
tight enough pressure gradient down across the region to produce moderate to
locally strong trades. As this high slowly moved northeast away from the area
and subtly weakened the gradient, trades gradually weakened. There was no
measurable precipitation during the mooring recovery, and surface
currents were less than 1 kt.

CTD casts conducted near the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} buoy (Station 52) before recovery
({numref}`figure6.10`) displayed a subsurface salinity maximum between 150 and
170 dbar and a mixed layer 60 dbar deep.

The temperature MicroCAT records during the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} deployment
({numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Temp_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Temp_21.png`) show
noticeable seasonal variability in the upper 100 m. A temperature decrease in
October-November 2019 was evident in the instruments below 65 m. The salinity
records ({numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Sali_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Sali_21.png`) do
not show an apparent seasonal cycle, but a salinity increase was recorded
during October-November 2019, by the instruments between 40 and 85 m,
coinciding with the temperature decrease. This increase was followed by a
period of low salinity (less than 35 on average above 120 m) throughout
2020-2021, with extreme values (nearly 34.4) above 120 m in November-December
2019, and above 75 m in July-September 2020.

{numref}`w1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_contTS.png` through {numref}`w1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_cont_S.png` show contours of
the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} MicroCAT data in context with data from the previous 15
deployments. The seasonal cycle is evident in the temperature record, with
record temperatures (higher than 26°C) in the summer of 2004, and again in
2014, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020. Salinities in the subsurface salinity maximum
were relatively low during the first 6 years of the record, only to increase
drastically after 2008 through 2015, with some lower salinity episodes in
mid-2011 and early 2012. The salinity maximum extended to near the surface in
early 2010, 2011, late2012-early 2013, and February-March 2013. Salinities in
the salinity minimum decreased after 2015, showing low salinities above 100 m
in 2016, 2017, 2018, and reaching record low values (34.4) in July-August 2019
and July-September 2020. When plotted in {math}`\sigma\theta` coordinates
({numref}`w1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_cont_S.png`), the salinity maximum seems to be centered roughly
between 24 and 24.5 {math}`\sigma\theta`.

Records from the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} MicroCATs ({numref}`plt_w{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_aco_all.png`) deployed
near the bottom of the mooring (4713 m) detected temperature and salinity
changes related to episodic ‘cold events’ apparently caused by bottom water
moving between abyssal basins {cite}`Lukas2001`. These events are being
monitored by instruments at the ALOHA Cabled Observatory (ACO) {cite}`Howe2011`
, a deep water observatory located at the bottom of Station ALOHA (about 6
nautical miles north from the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} anchor), since June 2011.
{numref}`plt_w{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_aco_all.png` shows temperature and salinity records from
the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} MicroCATs superimposed on the ACO data. The MicroCAT data
agreed with the temperature decrease and the salinity variability
registered by ACO instruments during cold events in January, March and
December 2020, and a minor events in August 2020 and September 2021.

{numref}`WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_u_subplot.png` through {numref}`WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_w_subplot.png` shows
the time series of the zonal, meridional, and vertical currents recorded with
the moored ADCPs during the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} deployment.
{numref}`wh1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_adcp_uv_cont.png`, through {numref}`wh1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_adcp_w_cont.png`,
shows the ADCP current components' contours in context with data from the
previous deployments. Despite the gaps in the data, an apparent variability is
seen in the zonal and meridional currents, apparently caused by passing eddies.
There have been periods of intermittent positive or negative zonal currents on
top of this variability, for instance, during 2007-2008. The contours of the
vertical current component {numref}`wh1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_adcp_w_cont.png` show a transition
in the magnitude of the contours near 47 m, indicating that the 300 kHz ADCP
located at 126 m moves more vertically than the 600 kHz ADCP located at 47.5 m.

A comparison between the moored ADCP data and the shipboard ADCP data obtained
during the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} cruise is shown in
{numref}`whots{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}deploy_adcp_contour1.png`, and
{numref}`whots{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}deploy_adcp_contour2.png`, and a similar comparison during the
WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.next_whots_deployment}} cruise is shown in {numref}`whots{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}recover_adcp_contour1.png` and
{numref}`whots{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}recover_adcp_contour2.png`. Some differences were seen,
especially in the zonal component, maybe due to the mooring motion, which was
not removed from the data. Comparisons between the available shipboard ADCP
from HOT-316 to -332 cruises and the mooring data are shown in
{numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_1.png` through
{numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_4.png`.

The Xeos-GPS receiver registered the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} buoy motion, and its positions
are plotted in {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}xeos_pos.png`. The buoy was located west of the
anchor for most of the deployment, except from around June to November 2020,
when it was east. The power spectrum of these data ({numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}xeos_pos.png`)
shows extra energy at the inertial period (~31 hr). Combining the buoy motion
with the tilt (a combination of pitch and roll) from the ADCP data
({numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_adcp_tilt.png`) showed that the tilt increased as the buoy
distance from the anchor WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} increased. This was expected since the
inclination of the cable increases as the buoy moves away from the anchor.

## CTD Profiling Data

## Thermosalinograph Data

Underway measurements of near-surface temperature and salinity from the
thermosalinograph (TSG) system onboard the R/V Oscar Sette cruise are presented
in {numref}`ac39thsl_final.png` and navigational data is shown in
{numref}`ac39nav_final.png` for the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} cruise. The WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} underway
seawater system that feeds the TSG failed on October 11, 2019, due to air
going into the plumbing, causing the pumps to stop working during
deteriorated weather conditions. TSG and navigational data during the
WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.next_whots_deployment}} cruise, onboard the R/V Oscar Sette, are presented in {numref}
`ac40thsl_final.png` and {numref}`ac40nav_final.png`, respectively. The
data between August 25 and 27, 2021 are particularly bad because it was
during transit back to Oahu to disembark a crew member with medical
problems, and the flow through the system was stopped during that time.

## MicroCAT Data

The temperatures measured by MicroCATs during the mooring deployment for
WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} are presented in {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Temp_1_4.png` through
{numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Temp_21.png` for each of the depths where the instruments
were located. The salinities are plotted in {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Sali_1_4.png`
through {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Sali_21.png`. The potential densities ({math}`\sigma\theta`) are
plotted in {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Sigma_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_Sigma_21.png`.

Contoured plots of temperature and salinity as a function of depth for the
deployments WHOTS-1 through -16 are presented in {numref}`w1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_contTS.png`,
and contoured plots of potential density ({math}`\sigma\theta`) as a function of depth are in
{numref}`w1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_contSt.png`, and of salinity as a function of {math}`\sigma\theta`
are in {numref}`w1_{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_cont_S.png`.

The potential temperature ({math}`\theta`) and salinity measured by the deep MicroCATs
during the mooring deployment are shown in {numref}`plt_w{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_aco_all.png`. Also
shown in the plot are the {math}`\theta` and salinity data obtained with a MicroCAT (SBE-37)
installed in the ALOHA Cabled Observatory, about six nautical miles north from
the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} anchor. The instrument is located 2 m above the bottom.

Comparisons between quality-controlled moored ADCPs during the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}
deployment and available shipboard ADCP obtained during regular HOT cruises 316
to 332, and during the mooring deployment (WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}) and recovery (WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.next_whots_deployment}})
cruises are shown in {numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_1.png` and
{numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_3.png` for the 300 kHz ADCP. Median and mean
velocity profiles were computed when HOT CTD casts were being conducted near
the WHOTS mooring specifically intended to calibrate moored instrumentation
(see {ref}`/5_section.md#conductivity-calibration`). The HOT shipboard profiles
were taken when the ship was stationary, within 1 km of the mooring, and within
4 hours before the start and 4 hours after the end of the CTD cast conducted
near the WHOTS mooring.

HOT-316 was conducted on the R/V Oceanus and used data from TRDI Workhorse 300
kHz ADCP (wh300) with 2 m bin size, and averaging ensembles every 2 minutes;
and from a TRDI Ocean Surveyor 75 kHz operating in broadband mode (os75nb) with
16 m bin size, with 5-minute ensemble interpolated to the profile resolution of
the shipboard ADCP, and ensemble mean, and median profiles were obtained for
each data set to compute differences and correlation coefficients between them.

HOT cruises conducted on the R/V Kilo Moana (HOT-317 to HOT-332) used data from
a TRDI Workhorse 300 kHz ADCP (wh300) with 2 m bin size and averaging
ensembles every 2 minutes; HOT-317 to HOT-319 and HOT-326 to HOT-332
used data from a TRDI Ocean Surveyor 38 kHz operating in broadband mode
(os38bb) with 12 m bin size, with 5-minute ensemble interpolated to the profile
resolution of the shipboard ADCP. HOT-317 to HOT-319 and HOT-326 to HOT-332
also used data from a TRDI Ocean Surveyor 38 kHz operating in narrowband mode
(os38nb) with 24 m bin size, with 5-minute ensemble. HOT-324 only used data
from the wh300 and os38nb (only three beams were working) instruments. HOT-326
also displayed issues with the os38 instrument.

Comparisons between the 300 kHz and the shipboard ADCP were available for
HOT-316, HOT-318 to -325, HOT-327 to -329
({numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_1.png`), and HOT-331 to -332
({numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_3.png`); data from all others HOT cruises
were excluded due to a lack of comparable data.

Comparisons between the moored 600 kHz and the shipboard ADCP were only
available for HOT-316 and HOT-318 due to a mechanical issue with 600 kHz
ADCP on January 21, 2020 ({numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_2.png` and

## Mooring Motion

The position of the mooring with respect to its anchor was determined from the
GPS positions. Additional information on the mooring motion was provided by the
ADCP data of pitch, roll, and heading, shown in this section.

{numref}`wh{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}}_adcp_tilt.png` shows the ADCP data of the instrument’s tilt (a
combination of the pitch and roll), plotted against the buoy’s distance from
its anchor (derived from GPS positions), for both WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_deployment_number}} ADCP’s. The plot's
red line is a quadratic fit to the median tilt calculated every 0.2 km distance
bins. The figure shows that during both deployments, the ADCP tilt increased as
the anchor's distance increased. This tilting was caused by the mooring line's
deviation from its vertical position as the anchor pulled it. The tilting of
the line also caused the rising of the instruments attached to the line. The
600 kHz ADCP failed in January 2021.
