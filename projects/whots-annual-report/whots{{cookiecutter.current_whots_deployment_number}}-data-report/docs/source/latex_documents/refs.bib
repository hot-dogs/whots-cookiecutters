   abstract = {The accuracies of the meteorological sensors (air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, near-surface temperature, longwave and shortwave radiation, and wind speed and direction) that compose the Improved Meteorological (IMET) system used on buoys at long-term ocean time series sites known as ocean reference stations (ORS) are analyzed to determine their absolute error characteristics. The predicted errors are compared to in situ measurement discrepancies and other observations (direct flux shipboard sensors) to confirm the predictions. The meteorological errors are then propagated through bulk flux formulas and the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) algorithm to give predicted errors for the heat flux components, the freshwater flux, and the momentum flux. Absolute errors are presented for three frequency bands [instantaneous (1-min sampling), diurnal, and annual]. The absolute uncertainty in the annually averaged net heat flux is found to be 8Wm-2 for conditions similar to the current ORS deployments in the subtropics. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {The recently developed IMET (improved meteorology) system for ships and buoys and the key elements of the program that led to its development are described. The system improves the ability to measure mean meteorological variables, including wind velocity, barometric pressure, incoming shortwave and longwave radiation, air temperature, sea surface temperature, humidity, and precipitation, from both types of platforms. Extensive laboratory and field tests of a variety of sensors were conducted to investigate and document their stability, accuracy, and reliability. Modular electronics were developed so that each sensor in the system communicated digitally, returning calibrated values to a central data recorder. IMET systems have been deployed on buoys in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and on research vessels. The history of the program, reasons for the choice of the present sensor suite, the design of the sensor modules, a description of the data acquisition system, and examples of data collected with the system are described. A discussion of the areas in which further improvements to the system will be sought is also provided.},

@article{Lukas2001,
   abstract = {During 1991–1999 six near-bottom, cold water anomaly events occurred at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series deep-ocean hydrographic station (22°45′N, 158°W), situated on the northern flank of a seafloor basin known as the Kauai Deep. Cold anomalies of at least 0.01°C, and as much as 0.024°C, were observed in near-bottom CTD profiles during each event. The anomalies relaxed towards more typical conditions over a period of several months. On the basis of water mass properties, we infer that the cold anomalies in the Kauai Deep originated when colder, saltier water from the adjacent Maui Deep spilled over the sill that separates these abyssal basins. The cause of these cold overflow events is not yet known, but inverted echo sounder observations and TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data suggest that they might be associated with eddies entering the region of the Maui Deep. The transport across the sill and the vertical structure of the eddy diffusivity parameter were estimated with a one-dimensional advection–diffusion model, considering the evolving shape of the anomalous potential temperature profile during the third event onset and the apparent overflow duration. The best subjective fit to the observations yields a transport across the sill of 0.18Sv, and a constant vertical eddy diffusivity of 7×10−4m2s−1. The observations during the recovery of the anomalous temperatures for four of the events were used to calculate the terms of a one-dimensional diffusion model, yielding the vertical and temporal variability of the turbulent diffusivity. The results show a consistent picture of the eddy diffusivity reaching median values of 40×10−4m2s−1 near the region of the sill depth and decreasing above and below it. This maximum increase seems to be due to enhanced levels of turbulence near the depth of the controlling sill. The diffusivities also peak at the beginning of the relaxation period, decreasing by one order of magnitude by the end of each event. The fifth event's overflow was apparently captured in progress with two full-depth CTD profiles obtained 46h apart, during which the near-bottom temperature decreased 0.035°C, the salinity increased 0.003, and the dissolved oxygen increased 7μmolkg−1. A seiching motion or deep baroclinic basin mode resulting from the event could explain this and other large differences in near-bottom temperatures observed between deep casts taken a few days apart.},

This report documents recovery of the WHOTS-1 mooring, deployed in August 2004 near 22.75°N, 158°W, and deployment of the WHOTS-2 mooring at the same site. Both moorings were outfitted with Air-Sea Interaction Meteorology (ASIMET) systems to measure, record, and transmit the surface meteorological variables necessary to compute air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum. In cooperation with R. Lukas of the University of Hawaii, the upper 155 m of the moorings were outfitted with oceanographic sensors for the measurement of temperature, conductivity and velocity. The WHOTS mooring turnaround was done on the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Ship Melville, Cruise TUIM-10MV. The cruise took place between 23 and 30 July 2005.},
